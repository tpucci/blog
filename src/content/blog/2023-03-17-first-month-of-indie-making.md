description: First learnings and thoughts
excerpt: Aside from my job as an Engineering Manager, I started to work on an idea. Here are the questions I had, my thoughts and my struggles.

It's been 60 days since I've started to work on an idea. I will share on the internet what it is piece by piece as I am making up my mind on it. Basically:

- it is a Figma's like infinite canvas
- on which you see your team tasks and their dependencies
- the main goal is for your brain to put a task in a 2D space and not in a column that represent its state

Its little name is **"Cadence"**.

## 1st learning: build without mockups but good defaults

It's the 3rd side project I have started and yet the only one still alive.
I think it is because I don't spend so much time in Figma designing what I want it to be, and then stopping everything because I know all that design is going to cost a sh\*tload of time üòÖ Funny how my own mockups demotivates me.

I've started to use tailwind CSS a couple of months and got it: I don't need a mockup. Let's go piece by piece and we'll see.

And woo-hoo ! 2 months done and still want to continue.

## 2nd learning: closed source now, open source later

I strongly believe in Cadence üôÇ
However, I don't code full time on it. So I spend weeks wondering if I should open source it or not. Because I am a strong transparency by open sourcing believer !

After some consideration, and seeing other products on the internet, I have decided that I'll get that transparency making my software local only. Thus, anyone could inspect the network layer and see there's nothing wrong about the software...

## 3rd learning: local only

...plus there's a **ton** of advantages of being local only:

- no server
- no server cost
- no server security

## My main struggle: get an audience on Twitter

I know I need to get out there and meet friends on the internet.

I took this [excellent course](https://sparklp.co/c96c20a9/) from [Kevon](https://twitter.com/MeetKevon) that really changed my behavior on Twitter: be natural, genuine, reply, quote, retweet, engage privately.

I hope I'll get results !

## Bonus ‚≠êÔ∏è

## 4rth learning: Flutter is a great choice to avoid my product from being copied

After trying to code my product in React, stop, and rewriting my product in Flutter for performance matters, I realized that I got a new big advantage on the web:

**The product is shipped to clients in Web Assembly.**

Meaning:

**No one can understand that compiled code. Nor change the style and host it somewhere else, and market it better than me.**

Nothing important here, as in JS you can obfuscate the code. Still... Cherry on top üçí.

Counterpart: there is nothing like tailwind in Flutter. But Material is ok for now.
