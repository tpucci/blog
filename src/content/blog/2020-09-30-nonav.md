title: NoNav for better mobile app navigation
description: NoNav, our paradigm to make UX dynamic apps
excerpt: In apps containing a lot of funnels and guided paths, it is not very usefull to let the user look for its content. Instead, we can use the data and sensors state and the date time to automatically navigate inside the app.
